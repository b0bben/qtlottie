# QtLottie

QtLottie is a tiny C++ library that can render [Adobe® After Effects™](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as JSON with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web).

## Features

- Support many After Effects features (depends on the specific backend).
- Cross-platform: support Windows (7~10), Linux and macOS.
- Support both Qt Widgets and Qt Quick.
- Support all versions from Qt5 to Qt6.
- Very easy to build and use.

## Build

```bash
cmake .
cmake --build .
cmake --install .
```

Currently QtLottie supports two backends: [skottie](https://github.com/xspeed1989/SkottieWrapper) and [rlottie](https://github.com/Samsung/rlottie). QtLottie will load it dynamically at run-time. Make sure you have build it and put it in the executable's directory before you run your application. While this library is initializing, skottie is prefered over rlottie.

## Usage

See [examples](/examples).

## Limitation

If your JSON uses assets, these files can only be placed on the disk, they can't be compressed or embeded into any container-like thing. It's caused by technical limitation, PRs are  welcome.
